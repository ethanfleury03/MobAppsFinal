Ideas:
1. Animal Adoption Finder
  Input:
    - Would take a animal type, color, breed, age, or whatever other options we think of
    - Add a feature where we can take user home address and tell them how far they are by car ride to shelter
  Output:
    - Find closest shelter that has everything that user decises and returns address, name, age, or whatever 
    - Also return distance (mi) from their home address
  Tools:
    - Andoid Studio
    - Api's
